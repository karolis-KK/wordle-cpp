# Wordle Clone

## Overview
This project is a C++ implementation of a Wordle clone, inspired by the original game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

Feel free to add more words to the `words.txt` file. If you choose to do so, remember to update this line at the start of the code:
```cpp
uniform_int_distribution<int> dist(1, word count);
```

**I recommend running the code in VSC, because the colours in the console output might not show up in other IDEs**
